# Kgastor: a Privacy By Design Knowledge Graph anonymized Store

This repository is part of the supplemental material related to our paper submission for the ISWC 2022 conference. Here, we provide:

> -  The code used to produce the evaluation for our partitioning approach (Figures 4 to 6) in the directory *kgastor_partitioning_eval*.
> -  The code used to produce the evaluation for our anonymization approach (Figures 7 to 10) in the directory *kgastor_m_invariance*.
> -  Additional evaluation for the anonymization approach with regards to update volumes in the directory *update_volume_evaluation*.
> -  A detailed description of our own implementation of m-invariance's split phase in directory *split_phase_algo*.
